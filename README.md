Adaption for EMG Pattern Recognitio

## About
mMyoHMI is an mobile Human-Machine Interface (HMI) system designed for real-time interaction using Electromyography (EMG) signals. It leverages the capabilities of the Myo armband, a wearable device that captures EMG signals from the muscles in the forearm. This system uniquely integrates two models: a Deep Learning (DL) model based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for robust feature extraction and a Machine Learning (ML) model using Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) for efficient on-device adaptation. mMyoHMI is tailored to adapt dynamically to biological heterogeneity that exist between different users, enhancing its usability for EMG pattern recognition. The project aims to push the boundaries of EMG-based interfaces, providing a platform for both research and practical implementations in areas like prosthetics, rehabilitation, and interactive systems.
